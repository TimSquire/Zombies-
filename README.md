# Zombies-

This game is modelled after Call of Duty, Black OPs Zombies.

As of now, I do not have a solution to posting the game online. If you are reading this and are interested in seeing the gameplay, please contact me and 
I will see how I can get it to you.

How it Works:
This is a round-based survival game in which the spawning zombies will appear in greater numbers, with more health and quickness with the passing of each round.
The player can purchase several weapons and upgrades. Every few rounds, a large zombies with more health and strength than the others will spawn as an additional challenge for the player. Furthermore, there is a timer ticking down and if it reaches zero the game ends. The player can gain more time by eliminating all zombies in the round.

If the player is killed or runs out of time, the game ends!
